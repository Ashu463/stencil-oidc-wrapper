# Auth Service

## Overview

Many organizations are transitioning to use FusionAuth instead of OAuth 2.0 due to its extensive range of services beyond standard OAuth 2.0 functionalities. Key services provided by FusionAuth include:

### Comprehensive IAM Platform

- **Authentication**: Password-based authentication, social login (e.g., Google, Facebook), Single Sign-On (SSO)
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **User Management**:
  - User registration and profile management
  - Password recovery and account management

...and many more.

## What Does This Auth Service Do

This auth service is essentially a lightweight version of FusionAuth, providing essential functionalities such as:

- **Authentication**
- **Authorization**
- **User Management**
- **Application Management**
- **Memory Management**

## Issues Resolved by This Auth Service

- This auth service addresses memory management issues, effectively managing resources even when registering a large number of users (e.g., using 117 MB for registering 100 users).

## Key Features

- **Key APIs**: Used to manage cryptographic keys for authentication. For more details, refer to the [Key-API documentation](key-api-readme.md).

- **Refresh Tokens APIs**: Used to perform CRUD operations on access tokens and JWT. For more details, refer to the [Refresh Token documentation](refreshToken.md).

- **Groups APIs**: Used to organize users into groups. For more details, refer to the [Group APIs documentation](Group.md) and to [Group Diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/185s3XVx5HdGO2ItTXmZDDBVj3CIylVhI/view?usp=sharing)

- **Tenants**: Named objects representing discrete namespaces for Users, Applications, and Groups. For more details, refer to the [Tenant documentation](Tenants.md).
- **Users** : Used to manage features provided regarding Users. For more details, refer to [User docs](User.md) and to [User Diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xXhFhM5WwMYZE9QaD47STtHsJcOsNliO/view?usp=sharing).

- **Application** : Used to manage application CRUD operations. For more details, refer to [Application docs](Application.md) and to [Application diagrams](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xnLQehVQc22FkDvubRN7tJR0fOQUdYKI/view?usp=sharing).

- **OTP** : Used to perform authentication using OTP. For more details, refer to [OTP docs](OTP.md)

## Application and Significance

- Comprehensive user management
- Efficient memory utilization
- Streamlined authentication and authorization processes
- Simplified application management

This service is designed to offer a balance of necessary features from FusionAuth while ensuring efficient resource management, making it suitable for applications with focused user and application management needs.

## Schema of Service 
The proposed schema which will act as skeleton for the service.

### application_oauth_scopes
`applications_id` - application to which the scope belong
`name` - name of the scope

### application_roles
`applications_id` - 
`description` - 
`is_default` - whether the role is default or not
`is_super_role` - whether it is admin role
`name` - name of the role
`description` - about the role
`application_oauth_scopes_id` - the scopes allowed to a particular role

### applications
`active` - in service or not
`data` - configurations of application
`name` - name of application
`tenants_id` - tenant it is using
`templates_link_json` - contains the link of various templates in json format

### tenants
`access_token_signing_keys_id` - id of key used to sign the access tokens
`id_token_signing_keys_id` - id of key used to sign identity tokens
`name` - name of tenant
`data` - configurations and extra settings of tenant

### user_registration
`applications_id` - application id
`authentication_token` - the token created while authenticating the user
`data` - stores tokens and preferred languages

### users
`tenants_id` - tenant to which it belongs to
`groups_id` - groups to which it belongs to

### keys / jwks
`algorithm` - algo used
`certificate` - certificate of key
`issuer` - the issuer(we) of key
`kid`
`private_key`
`public_key`
`secret`

### groups
`tenants_id` - tenant it is using

### group_members
`users_id` - id of user
`groups_id` - id of group to which the particular user belongs to

## group_application_roles
`application_roles_id` - the role which is placed in a group
`groups_id` - the group to which a particular role belongs to

## REQUIRED -
 1. `application_oauth-scopes`, 
 2. `application roles`, 
 3. `applications [active,data/config, name, tenants_id, templates_link_json]`,
 4. ` authentication_keys`,
 5.  `groups / roles` (id,permissions,name) and `users` will have an optional group field, can handle permissions for both users and organizations(entities), and tenants/settings in a setting attribute containing(id_token_sign_key, access_token_sign_key)
 6.  `user` (expiry,data -> json,groupid->array)
 7.  `refresh_tokens`
 8.  `keys`
 9.  
   
### Notes


## NOT REQUIRED - 
application_daily/monthly_active_users, audit logs (we will be using telemetry logs)
1. `identities`
## RESEARCH REQUIRED - 
1. `families`
  these are focussed more on familial relationships like parent and child. Inclued management features like parental controls. Unlike groups emphazise roles and permissions allowing buld assignment of access rights and roles to users.
2. `entity_entity_grant`
3. `form_fields`
    used with `forms` and `form_steps` to create a custom form field for taking inputs. `forms` are customizable objects that consists of many `form_steps` which in turn contains `form_fields`
4. `entity_type_permissions`
5. `connectors`
    just like identity providers they can be used to connect fusionauth to an external system of record for user identity.
6. `user_actions`
   User Actions in FusionAuth are ways to interact with, reward, and discipline users. For example, you could use them to email a user, call another application when a user does something, or temporarily disable a userâ€™s login.
7. `consents`
    Consent is a definition of a permission that can be given to a User. Can't find the difference b/w this and grants`

Create the file with the given contents.
After creating the file
1. `docker compose up -d`
2. FusionAuth on `localhost:9011`
3. Hasura on `localhost:8080/console`
4. After you are done, do `docker compose down -v`
